Howto use GNU autotools to generate platform-dependency Makefile.

Step:
1. Prepare "configure.ac" for GNU aclocal.

2. Run "aclocal" to generate some files.
       aclocal.m4
       autom4te.cache/

3. Prepare "Makefile.am" for GNU automake.

3. Run "automake --add-missing --copy" to generate some files:
       Makefile.in
       config.guess
       config.sub
       depcomp
       install-sh
       missing

4. Run "autoconf" to generate final files:
       configure

5. Run "configure" to generate "Makefile", and then you can build your source.
